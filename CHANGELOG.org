#+STARTUP: hidestars showall
* conjecture changelog
** 0.4.0
   - Adds singleton fixtures.
** 0.3.0
   - Compatible with Clojure 1.2.1.
   - Renamed groupId to conjecture.
   - Renamed namespaces from name.stadig.* => conjecture
** 0.2.0
   - Runs fixtures when you call a function as a test (e.g. at a REPL)
   - Removes support for singleton fixtures.  They did not provide an
     opportunity to clean up, and it would be better to have some kind of
     once-for-the-test-run fixture that did allow for cleanup.
** 0.1.0
   - Initial fork of clojure.test
   - Adds support for creating idempotent and singleton fixtures.
